        <h4 style="text-align: center;">ORIGINS:</h4>
        <p class="history">- Everything started in 1810, the first Oktoberfest festival was held on October 12, 1810, to celebrate the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria to Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The citizens of Munich were invited to join in the festivities, which included horse races. The event was such a success that it was decided to hold it again the following year.
            <br><br>
            - After some years, the festival began to evolve, with the introduction of carousels and swings. Small beer stands appeared, which eventually grew into large beer tents and halls.

                <p class="history">
                    - In 1910, the 100th anniversary of Oktoberfest was celebrated with an estimated 120,000 liters of beer consumed.
                    <br><br>
                    - From 1914 until 1918, and from 1939 until 1945, Oktoberfest was canceled because of World War I and World War II. After WWII, it resumed in 1946 but was called the "Autumn Festival" until 1948.
